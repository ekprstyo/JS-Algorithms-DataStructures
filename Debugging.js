/* Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools, for debugging your JavaScript.

You can find Developer tools in your Chrome's menu or Web Console in Firefox's menu. If you're using a different browser, or a mobile phone, we strongly recommend switching to desktop Firefox or Chrome.

The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.

Here's an example to print the string Hello world! to the console:

console.log('Hello world!');

Use the console.log() method to print the value of the variable a where noted in the code.
*/

let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);

/* Should :
Your code should use console.log() to check the value of the variable a.

/* Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

You may have noticed that some freeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges include their own console. This console behaves a little differently than the browser console you used in the last challenge.

The following challenge is meant to highlight the main difference between the freeCodeCamp console and your browser console.

When you run ordinary JavaScript, the browser's console will display your console.log() statements the exact number of times it is called.

The freeCodeCamp console will print your console.log() statements a short time after the editor detects a change in the script, as well as during testing.

The freeCodeCamp console is cleared before the tests are run and, to avoid spam, only prints the logs during the first test (see the note below for exceptions).

If you would like to see every log for every test, run the tests, and open the browser console. If you prefer to use the browser console, and want it to mimic the freeCodeCamp console, place console.clear() before any other console calls, to clear the browser console.

Note: console.logs inside functions are printed to the freeCodeCamp console whenever those functions are called. This can help debugging functions that are called during testing.

First, use console.log to log the output variable. Then, use console.clear to clear the browser console.
*/

// Open your browser console.
let output = "Get this to log once in the freeCodeCamp console and twice in the browser console";
// Use console.log() to print the output variable.
console.log(output);
// Run the tests to see the difference between the two consoles.
console.clear();
// Now, add console.clear() before your console.log() to clear the browser console, and pass the tests.

/* Should :
Passed

You should use console.clear() to clear the browser console.
Passed

You should use console.log() to print the output variable.
*/

/* Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using typeof:

console.log(typeof "");
console.log(typeof 0);
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof {});

In order, the console will display the strings string, number, object, and object.

JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol (new with ES6) and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.

Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.
*/

let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
// Turn to
let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);

/* Should :
Your code should use typeof in two console.log() statements to check the type of the variables.
Passed

Your code should use typeof to check the type of the variable seven.
Passed

Your code should use typeof to check the type of the variable three.
*/

/*Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names

The console.log() and typeof methods are the two primary ways to check intermediate values and types of program output. Now it's time to get into the common forms that bugs take. One syntax-level issue that fast typers can commiserate with is the humble spelling error.

Transposed, missing, or mis-capitalized characters in a variable or function name will have the browser looking for an object that doesn't exist - and complain in the form of a reference error. JavaScript variable and function names are case-sensitive.

Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works.
*/

let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = recievables - payable;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);
// Turn to
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);

/* Should :
Check the spelling of the two variables used in the netWorkingCapital calculation, the console output should show that "Net working capital is: 2".
Passed

There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.
Passed

The receivables variable should be declared and used properly in the code.
Passed

There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.
Passed

The payables variable should be declared and used properly in the code.
*/

/* Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes

Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and quotes have a closing pair. Forgetting a piece tends to happen when you're editing existing code and inserting items with one of the pair types. Also, take care when nesting code blocks into others, such as adding a callback function as an argument to a method.

One way to avoid this mistake is as soon as the opening character is typed, immediately include the closing match, then move the cursor back between them and continue coding. Fortunately, most modern code editors generate the second half of the pair automatically.

Fix the two pair errors in the code.
*/

let myArray = [1, 2, 3;
    let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current =>  previous + current);
    console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}`);
// Turn to
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current) =>  previous + current);
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}`);

/* Should :
Your code should fix the missing piece of the array.

Your code should fix the missing piece of the .reduce() method. The console output should show that Sum of array values is: 6.
*/

/* Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes

JavaScript allows the use of both single (') and double (") quotes to declare a string. Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.

Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's in quotes. Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.

Here are some examples of mixing quotes:

const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'";
const uhOhGroucho = 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';

The first two are correct, but the third is incorrect.

Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (\) escape character:

const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';

Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the href value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.
*/

let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href="#Home">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);
// Turn to
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);++

/* Should :
Your code should fix the quotes around the href value #Home by either changing or escaping them.
Passed

Your code should keep the double quotes around the entire string.
*/

/*Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator

Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on if, else if, and else statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.

This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as "if x equals y, then ..." which can literally translate into code using the =, or assignment operator. This leads to unexpected control flow in your program.

As covered in previous challenges, the assignment operator (=) in JavaScript assigns a value to a variable name. And the == and === operators check for equality (the triple === tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are the same).

The code below assigns x to be 2, which evaluates as true. Almost every value on its own in JavaScript evaluates to true, except what are known as the "falsy" values: false, 0, "" (an empty string), NaN, undefined, and null.

let x = 1;
let y = 2;
if (x = y) {

} else {

}

In this example, the code block within the if statement will run for any value of y, unless y is falsy. The else block, which we expect to run here, will not actually run.

Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to result.
*/

let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x = y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);
// Turn to
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x === y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);

/* Should :
Your code should fix the condition so it checks for equality, instead of using assignment.
Passed

The condition should use either == or === to test for equality.
*/

/* Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call

When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it. Often times the result of a function call is saved in a variable for other use in your code. This error can be detected by logging variable values (or their types) to the console and seeing that one is set to a function reference, instead of the expected value the function returns.

The variables in the following example are different:

function myFunction() {
  return "You rock!";
}
let varOne = myFunction;
let varTwo = myFunction();

Here varOne is the function myFunction, and varTwo is the string You rock!.

Fix the code so the variable result is set to the value returned from calling the function getNine.
*/

function getNine() {
    let x = 6;
    let y = 3;
    return x + y;
  }
  
  let result = getNine;
  console.log(result);
// Turn to
function getNine() {
    let x = 6;
    let y = 3;
    return x + y;
  }
  
  let result = getNine();
  console.log(result);

/* Should :
Your code should fix the variable result so it is set to the number that the function getNine returns.
Passed

Your code should call the getNine function.
*/
